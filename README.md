# Cursed Biology Iceberg

### Description
Inspired by (or perhaps, shamelessly ripped-off from) the [Cursed Computer Iceberg Meme](https://suricrasia.online/iceberg/). Catalogues and ranks some of the stranger parts of biology. View it [here](https://xanthine-adenine.github.io/cursed_biology_iceberg/) on GitHub Pages.

### What This is Not
- A comprehensive list of open questions/mysteries in Biology.
- A place for pseudoscience or things largely disproven.
- An objective ranking.
